            Addis Ababa, also spelled Addis Abeba, capital and largest city of
            Ethiopia. It is located on a well-watered plateau surrounded by
            hills and mountains in the geographic centre of the country. Only
            since the late 19th century has Addis Ababa been the capital of the
            Ethiopian state. Addis Ababa is the educational and administrative
            centre of Ethiopia. It is the site of Addis Ababa University (1950)
            and contains several teacher-training colleges and technical
            schools. Also located in the city are the Museum of the Institute of
            Ethiopian Studies and the Yared School of Music, both of which are
            operated by the university; the National Library and Archives;
            palaces of former emperors; and government ministries.

          <h2>Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church</h2>
          <p>
            utocephalous Oriental Orthodox church in Ethiopia. Headquarters are
            in Addis Ababa, the country’s capital. Tradition holds that Ethiopia
            was first evangelized by St. Matthew and St. Bartholomew in the 1st
            century CE, and the first Ethiopian convert is thought to have been
            the eunuch in Jerusalem mentioned in The Acts of the Apostles
            (8:27–40). Ethiopia was further Christianized in the 4th century CE
            by two men (likely brothers) from Tyre—St. Frumentius, later
            consecrated the first Ethiopian bishop, and Aedesius. They won the
            confidence of the king at Aksum (a powerful kingdom in northern
            Ethiopia) and were allowed to evangelize. The succeeding king,
            Ezana, was baptized by Frumentius, and Christianity was made the
            state religion. Toward the end of the 5th century, nine monks from
            Syria are said to have brought monasticism to Ethiopia and
            encouraged the translation of the Scriptures into the Geʿez
            language.
